# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic ECG (electrocardiogram) waveform visualization that responds in real-time to heart rate readings displayed on a medical dashboard. The ECG waveform will automatically adjust its frequency, amplitude, and characteristics based on the current heart rate data, providing healthcare professionals with an intuitive visual representation of cardiac activity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to see an ECG waveform that changes dynamically based on heart rate readings, so that I can quickly assess cardiac activity patterns visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the heart rate reading changes THEN the ECG waveform SHALL update its beat frequency to match the new heart rate within 1 second
2. WHEN the heart rate is between 60-100 BPM THEN the ECG waveform SHALL display a normal sinus rhythm pattern
3. WHEN the heart rate is below 60 BPM THEN the ECG waveform SHALL display a bradycardia pattern with slower beat intervals
4. WHEN the heart rate is above 100 BPM THEN the ECG waveform SHALL display a tachycardia pattern with faster beat intervals

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the ECG waveform to be visually accurate and medically representative, so that I can rely on it for clinical assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying any heart rate THEN the ECG waveform SHALL show the characteristic P-QRS-T complex morphology
2. WHEN the waveform is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain proper timing relationships between P, QRS, and T waves
3. WHEN the heart rate changes THEN the waveform SHALL smoothly transition between different frequencies without visual artifacts
4. IF the heart rate data is unavailable THEN the ECG waveform SHALL display a flat line or "no signal" indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the ECG waveform to be clearly visible and professionally styled, so that it integrates well with the medical dashboard interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ECG waveform is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate medical green color (#00FF00) for the trace line
2. WHEN rendered THEN the waveform SHALL include a grid background typical of ECG paper
3. WHEN displayed THEN the waveform SHALL have proper scaling with amplitude of 1-2 mV equivalent
4. WHEN integrated into the dashboard THEN the ECG component SHALL be responsive and fit within its container

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the ECG waveform to perform smoothly in real-time, so that it doesn't impact the overall dashboard performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the waveform is animating THEN it SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS for smooth visualization
2. WHEN heart rate data updates frequently THEN the ECG component SHALL not cause performance degradation
3. WHEN the waveform is running THEN it SHALL use efficient rendering techniques to minimize CPU usage
4. IF the browser tab becomes inactive THEN the ECG animation SHALL pause to conserve resources
